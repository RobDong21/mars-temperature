## Instructions:
### Background:

A new rover is heading to Mars and is expected to land around Feb next year. As a travel focused company, we want to prepare travelers for their arrival to their destination.


### Task:

Create a React.JS based website that shows, in big bold numbers, the latest known temperature on Mars. Note: I was told that the robot only understands the metric system.
